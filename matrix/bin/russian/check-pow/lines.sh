# Occasionally, a command has man pages in multiple section content areas. For example,
# there is a command called hostname. The man pages contain information on the command
# as well as an overview section on system hostnames. To see the pages desired, you type
# man section# topic. For the commandâ€™s man pages in section 1, type man 1
# hostname. For the overview man pages in section 7, type man 7 hostname.
