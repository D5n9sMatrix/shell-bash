# Typically, the man utility provides the lowest numbered content area for the command. For
# example, looking back to Figure 3-1 where the command man xterm was entered, notice
# that in the upper-left and upper-right display corners, the word XTERM is followed by a
# number in parentheses, (1). This means the man pages displayed are coming from content
# area 1 (executable programs or shell commands).
