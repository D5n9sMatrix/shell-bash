# When you use the man command to view a commandâ€™s manual pages, they are displayed
# with something called a pager. A pager is a utility that allows you to page through
# displayed text. Thus, you can page through the man pages by pressing the spacebar, or you
# can go line by line using the Enter key. In addition, you can use the arrow keys to scroll
# forward and backward through the man page text (assuming that your terminal emulation
# package supports the arrow key functions).
