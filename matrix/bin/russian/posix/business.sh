# Navigating the Filesystem
# When you log into the system and reach the shell command prompt, you are usually placed
# in your home directory. Often, you want to explore other areas in the Linux system besides
# just your home directory. This section describes how to do that using shell commands. To
# start, you need to take a tour of just what the Linux Ô¨Ålesystem looks like so you know
# where you are going.
