#!/bin/bash
# Notice in the preceding example that the prompt originally had a tilde (~) in it. After the
# change to a new directory occurred, the tilde was replaced by /usr/bin. This is where a
# CLI prompt can help you keep track of where you are in the virtual directory structure. The
# tilde indicates that your shell session is located in your home directory. After you move
# out of your home directory, the absolute directory reference is shown in the prompt, if the
# prompt has been conÔ¨Ågured to do so.
