# An absolute directory reference always begins with a forward slash (/), indicating the
# virtual directory systemâ€™s root. Thus, to reference user binaries, contained within the bin
# directory stored within the usr directory, you would use an absolute directory reference as
# follows:
BASH_SUBSHELL=/feature/
COMMITOR=/feature/
feature -f -a paper
ls -l
type=file
mode=file
type -f write
window=write
end=0
